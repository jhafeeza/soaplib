About
--------
Soaplib is an easy to use python library for publishing soap web services using
WSDL 1.1 standard, and answering SOAP 1.1 requests. With a very small amount of
code, soaplib allows you to write a useful web service and deploy it as a WSGI
application.

The official soaplib discussion forum can be found here.

The legacy versions of soaplib are also available in this repository. See here
for the stable soaplib-0.8 branch. See here for the stable soaplib-1.0 branch.
